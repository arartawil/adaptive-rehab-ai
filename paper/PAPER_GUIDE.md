**Timeline:** 1 month

## 📝 **Paper Structure (I Created Template)**

Created `paper/paper.tex` with:
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Related Work (needs citations)
- Architecture
- Implementation
- Evaluation (needs user study)
- Discussion
- Conclusion

## 🎯 **Recommended Path: Demo/Systems Paper**

**Why?** Fastest to publication, showcases your technical work.

**What you need to do:**

### Week 1-2: User Feedback
```
Recruit 10 people to try both games:
1. Play memory game (5 rounds)
2. Play reaction game (5 rounds)
3. Fill out survey:
   - Did difficulty feel appropriate? (1-5 scale)
   - Was the adaptation noticeable? (Yes/No)
   - Engagement level (NASA-TLX or custom)
   - Any frustration or boredom?
```

### Week 3: Literature Review
```
Find and cite 15-20 papers:
- VR rehabilitation systems (5 papers)
- Adaptive difficulty in games (5 papers)
- Flow theory applications (3 papers)
- AI in healthcare (5 papers)
```

### Week 4: Write Paper
```
Fill in template sections:
- Introduction (your motivation)
- Related Work (cite papers)
- System (describe architecture)
- Evaluation (user feedback results)
- Discussion (what worked, limitations)
```

## 📸 **Figures Needed**

Would you like me to help create:
1. **Architecture diagram** (system components)
2. **Performance graphs** (latency over time)
3. **UI screenshots** (demo games)
4. **User study results** (after you collect data)

## 🎓 **Target Conferences (2026)**

**Quick publication (3-4 months):**
- IEEE VR 2026 Workshop (March deadline)
- CHI 2026 Late-Breaking Work (December)
- ISMAR 2026 Poster/Demo (May)

**Full paper (6-8 months):**
- ISMAR 2026 (April deadline)
- IEEE VR 2027 (September deadline)
- CHI 2027 (September 2026)
